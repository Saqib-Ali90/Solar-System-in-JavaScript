# Solar-System-in-JavaScript
A simple and easy project using AI. It uses AI to create JavaScript code for Solar system 2D model
I have used the chatGPT for the code writing in JS. I copy/pasted the code into VS Code and saved as .html file and run in Chrome browser.
my first prompt "Create a code in JavaScript for a 2D solar system model"
2nd Prompt: "add moon around Earth and make background little darker"
3rd prompt "add two inner planets and add small labels on planets and moon"
4th prompt: "add outer planets, add 4 moons of jupiter too, and slow down the speed of planets"
